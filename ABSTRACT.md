# Parsing and refactoring FORTRAN code with XML

In this article, Philippe Marguinaud explains how XML can be used to parse 
a programming language such as FORTRAN. The first big advantage over other existing 
approaches is that XML can represent both structure and hand-written content.
The other benefit is that all power tools coming from the XML realm become instantly
available for searching and editing the syntax tree. Eventually, the article shows
how a FORTRAN syntax tree can be loaded in firefox, using an XSL stylesheet.
